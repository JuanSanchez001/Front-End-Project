							<h2>The Triassic Period</h2>
							<p>The Triassic period lasted 50.5 Million years, it was the very first and shortest period of the Mesozoic Era. It was divided into three periods; the Early Triassic, the Middle Triassic, and the Late Triassic. Dinosaurs first appeared in the Late Triassic period. The primary/dominant spieces of the Triassic period were the early ancestors of modern crocodilians called "pseudosuchians." Pangaea was the landmass that dominated during this time.</p>
