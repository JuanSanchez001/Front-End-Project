	<br>
	<p id="p2">This is one of our founders, he worked very hard on this museum and he loves dinosaurs. His love of dinosuars led him to make this site, he had the coding skills but none of the knowledge, so he contacted Founder #2. Together the two of them made this website together after this found convinced him to help him make this website. Most of the coding on this website is all done by this founder, who put his blood sweat and tears into trying and craft the perfect website for you! hes got pleny of coding experince and wants to spread his intereset of dinosaurs any way he can and teach as many people as possible about his interest, although he is still learning a lot about dinosaurs he did help put some of the inforamation on this website, but that was mostly done by Founder #2, since he is very very educated on the topic.</p>

	<br>
	<p id="p2">This is our second founder, he did quite a bit of work on this museum and likes making stuff like this. He has been working in various mueseums for years and with the help of founder 1 agreeded to help make this website, together the two founders were able to work together and make this website possible. This founder had a Phd in dinosaur history and helped us put in the information to this website and make sure that it was all correct. He was also able to help code this project, however most of the coding was done by Founder #1, who had the original idea to put this whole project together.</p>

	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions!</h2>
	<br>
	<button type="button" class="collapsible">&bull; Where are fossils found?</button>
	<div class="content">
	<p>Fossils are found all over the world, typically in sedimentary rocks and sediment-rich environments where ancient life was buried and preserved. Fossils are frequently discovered in geographic areas like deserts, river valleys, mountains, badlands, hillsides, and places of high erosion where ancient rock layers are exposed. Human-made exposures such as quarries, road cuttings, and mines can also be productive fossil sites. Outcrops, where wind and water erosion have revealed old rock, are good spots for fossil hunting.
		Sedimentary rocks like sandstone, mudstone, limestone, and ironstone are the main places fossils are preserved, largely due to burial under water or sediment millions of years ago. Occasionally, fossils are found in fine-grained, low-grade metamorphic rocks.
		Major fossil concentrations have been found in the badlands of China, Argentina, and North America. Famous US fossil sites include the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada, and the La Brea Tar Pits in California. Chinaâ€™s Liaoning Province is renowned for numerous feathered dinosaur fossils.
		Fossils have been found on every continent, including Antarctica. Most dinosaur species have been named from countries with varied geology such as the US, Canada, China, Argentina, and Mongolia. Many other countries and sites also produce a wide diversity of fossils, ranging from ancient bacteria to prehistoric mammals and dinosaurs.
		Fossils are most likely to be found where sedimentary rocks of the right age are exposed, and regions with active erosion or accessible rock layers are particularly promising for discoveries. - Perplexity</p>

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">&bull; What type of dinosaur fossils are there?</button>
	<div class="content">
		<p>There are many types of dinosaur fossils, classified mainly by their group and function. Dinosaur fossils can include bones, teeth, eggs, and footprints, and are divided into body fossils (parts of the organism) and trace fossils (such as footprints or nests). Dinosaurs are traditionally classified into two main orders: Saurischia and Ornithischia.
		Saurischia includes theropods, which were mostly carnivorous dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor, and sauropodomorphs, which were large, long-necked herbivores like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. Ornithischia includes many plant-eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and Ankylosaurus.
		Theropods are best known for fossilized bones, teeth, and sometimes feather impressions. Sauropodomorphs are often found as massive skeletons and large footprints. Ornithischians may be identified from bones, armor plates, horns, and frills.
		In summary, the main types of dinosaur fossils are bones, teeth, eggs, footprints, skin impressions, and sometimes feathers, classified across groups like theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians. Each group is often distinguished by unique features like horns, armor, claws, or body shape. - Perplexity</p>

	<br>
	<button type="button" class="collapsible">&bull; How are the same type of fossils found all over the world?</button>
	<div class="content">
		<p>The same type of fossils are found all over the world because ancient organisms often lived on supercontinents where landmasses were joined together, allowing species to spread widely before continental drift separated them. This is shown by identical fossil species discovered across Australia, South Africa, South America, India, and Antarctica.
		As continents drifted apart, these species became isolated, but the fossils remained distributed globally because they originated before the split. Fossil evidence thus supports the theory of plate tectonics and continental movement. Global patterns also emerge when similar environments on different continents support similar life forms, whose remains became fossilized in sedimentary rocks.
		Additionally, major extinction and diversification events affected global ecosystems, leaving records of identical or closely related organisms on multiple continents. Scientists often use fossils to reconstruct geographic and evolutionary history by comparing matching finds around the world. - Perplexity</p>

	<h2>We Hope You Enjoyed Our Mueseum!</h2>
	<br>
	<p id="p2">We hope that while you browsed our Mueseum you learned a lot about dinosaurs and all the different time periods they are from, we appreicate your support by reading this website and we hope you come back to see us again! Have a great day. Dinosaurs have fascinated people for generations, capturing imaginations with their sheer size, diversity, and mysterious extinction. Our mission is to bring these incredible creatures to life through engaging stories, research-based knowledge, and a passion for prehistoric history. We believe dinosaurs are more than just fossils; they are a gateway to understanding life on Earth millions of years ago and appreciating the evolutionary journey that shaped the world we know today. By blending science with storytelling, we create a space where curiosity thrives and discovery never ends.
	From the towering giants like Brachiosaurus to swift hunters like Velociraptor, dinosaurs represent resilience, adaptation, and the beauty of natural history. Our work is fueled by a dedication to making these creatures accessible and exciting for everyone, whether you are a student, a teacher, or simply someone captivated by the prehistoric world. We celebrate both the awe-inspiring scale and the intricate details of these species, bringing together research, creativity, and community to ensure that their legacy endures. Every fossil tells a story, and every story we share invites you to join us in exploring the ancient wonders of our planet. - Perplexity
