	<h2>The Triassic Period</h2>

The Triassic period, spanning from about 252 to 201 million years ago, marked the beginning of the Mesozoic Era. It followed the catastrophic Permian-Triassic extinction, which had wiped out nearly 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate life. During the early Triassic, ecosystems were fragile, and life on Earth struggled to recover. Over time, however, new species began to emerge, filling ecological niches left vacant by the extinction.
Geographically, the Triassic world was dominated by the supercontinent Pangaea, which stretched from pole to pole and created a massive, connected landmass. This arrangement contributed to extreme climates, since much of the interior of Pangaea was far from oceans and therefore subject to hot, dry desert-like conditions. Seasonal monsoons also played a role in shaping the ecosystems that developed along coastlines and in lowland areas.
In terms of plant life, gymnosperms such as conifers, cycads, and ginkgos thrived during the Triassic. These plants adapted well to the drier environments, spreading widely across Pangaea. Ferns and horsetails also played important roles in wetter regions. The widespread growth of these plants provided food and habitats for evolving herbivorous reptiles and early dinosaur species.
The Triassic period was a critical time for the rise of reptiles. Archosaurs, a group that included the ancestors of crocodiles, birds, and dinosaurs, diversified and became dominant. Early dinosaurs, though still relatively small and less numerous, began to appear toward the mid to late Triassic. Marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and nothosaurs swam in the oceans, adapting to predatory lifestyles in aquatic environments.
In addition to reptiles, mammals made their first appearance during the Triassic. These early mammals were small, shrew-like creatures that descended from synapsid ancestors. Though not dominant during this era, they represented the beginnings of a lineage that would eventually flourish after the extinction of dinosaurs millions of years later. The coexistence of mammals and dinosaurs began in the Triassic and would continue well into the Mesozoic.
The Triassic came to a dramatic close with another mass extinction event around 201 million years ago. This extinction devastated many marine reptiles, large amphibians, and some archosaurs, clearing ecological space for dinosaurs to undergo explosive diversification in the Jurassic period. With its role as a transitional chapter in Earth’s history, the Triassic period set the stage for the dinosaurs’ dominance and the continued evolution of new life forms. (written by Perplexity)
