	<p><b>The Triassic Period, spanning from roughly 252 to 201 million years ago, marked the beginning of the Mesozoic Era and followed the largest mass extinction event in Earth's history, the Permian-Triassic extinction. In this aftermath, life slowly recovered and diversified in a world dominated by the supercontinent Pangaea. The climate was generally hot and dry across much of the globe, with vast deserts and highly seasonal weather, though some polar and monsoonal regions provided more moisture. During this time, coal swamps nearly vanished, and the landscape was primarily covered with ferns, cycads, horsetails, and coniferous trees.

As ecosystems stabilized, the Triassic saw the rise of reptiles, especially the group known as archosaurs, which included early crocodilians, pterosaurs, and, notably, the very first dinosaurs late in the period. In the oceans, new marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs evolved, along with the earliest teleost fish and modern-style sharks. Amphibians, especially temnospondyls, survived from earlier ages but began to decline as reptiles became more dominant. The end of the Triassic also witnessed the first appearance of small, primitive mammals, which would later diversify extensively in the Jurassic.

The Triassic concluded with another mass extinction event, which paved the way for the dramatic rise of dinosaurs as the planetâ€™s dominant terrestrial animals in the Jurassic Period. The break-up of Pangaea started during this era, setting the stage for new continents and changing ocean currents and climates. This dynamic, transitional period established many of the major animal groups and ecological systems that would shape life on Earth for millions of years to come.
